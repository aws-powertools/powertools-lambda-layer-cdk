> Powertools for AWS will continue to provide official Lambda Layers for [Python](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/python/latest/) and [TypeScript](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/typescript/latest/) in all commercial regions and GovCloud, as well as future regions as they become available.

### Your options

**1. Use Managed Lambda layers (Recommended)**

Powertools for AWS managed Lambda layers offer:
 
- Optimization for each runtime and architecture
- Ongoing support and updates
- Availability across all commercial regions and GovCloud
- Simplified workflow that lets you focus on function code

**2. Build Custom Lambda Layers**

If you need custom layers:

- Use the open-source build pipeline from the main repositories
- Reference our implementation for your own deployment process


### Migration tips

- Plan your transition before the April 5, 2025 archival date
- Test thoroughly with the managed layers before migrating production workloads
- Review the documentation for [Python](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/python/latest/) and [TypeScript](https://docs.powertools.aws.dev/lambda/typescript/latest/) implementations
